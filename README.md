Projects source code and reports are contained in corresponding folder.

Data used for back-testing is in /Data folder.
Use static database for model development and backtesting:
For instance, use data from 2008-01-02 to 2009-12-31 as in-sample data to train the Machine Learning model, and data from 2010-01-04 to 2011-12-30 as out-of-sample data to back-test the performance of a certain strategy. Assume we were at 2009-12-31 and cannot peak into the future (any data after 2009-12-31).
